## Executive Summary

## Statement of Contribution

Most of the project work ran in a very collaborative dynamic. In the preliminary stages, there was a lively exchange between both project members, with most of the ideas and theoretical approaches of the project having been implicitly worked on in two parts.

In the advanced and practical stages, a certain division of labor crystallized. However, a large part of the project was approached in a co-working place, which is why many practical projects and especially problems were evaluated directly together.

In detail, the division of work was as follows:

- __Benedikt Ströbl__ mainly took care of the configuration of the HTML template and handled the different map data formats. He also created the visual map base.

- __Lukas Warode__ was mainly involved in setting up the Shiny backend and did a lot of the practical data manipulation inside and outside the `Shiny` reactivity. He also worked on the `ggplot2` foundation of descriptive statistics.
